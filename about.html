      <p class="about-p">
        Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee
        with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true
        when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
        Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike
        Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of
        the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired
        by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring
        tradition of the early coffee traders. In 1981, Howard Schultz
        (Starbucks chairman, president and chief executive officer) first walked
        into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn
        into Starbucks and joined a year later. A year later, in 1983, Howard
        travelled to Italy and became captivated by Italian coffee bars and the
        romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian
        coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for
        conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and
        home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il
        Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks
        with the help of local investors. From the beginning, Starbucks set out
        to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee
        and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
        Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one
        cup and one neighbourhood at a time. Today, with store in more than 75
        markets, Starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of speciality
        coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our
        heritage and an exceptional experience to life.
